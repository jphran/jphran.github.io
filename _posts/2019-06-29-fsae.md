## The Story

The <a href="https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events"> Formula SAE (FSAE) Electric</a> competitions challenge teams of university undergraduate and graduate students to conceive, design, fabricate, develop and compete with small, formula style vehicles. The competition is an engineering education competition that requires performance demonstration of vehicles in a series of events, both off track and on track against the clock. Each competition gives teams the chance to demonstrate their creativity and engineering skills in comparison to teams from other universities around the world.

The concept is simple: get four rolling wheels, a chassis, and drop a power plant in there. But the reality is brutal. Over a hundred pages of rules and regulations -- that keep us safe -- but also make the reality of design quite a bit more complicated than a typical garage project. On top of that, many parts are custom and therefore, don't have technical support. There's also the huge challenge of interdisciplinary integration. Getting a mechanical system to work nicely with the electrical and all of that to work nicely with the computers is a bit harder than just designing an upright or battery pack.

<a href="https://formulau.racing">Formula U Racing</a> is my student organized FSAE club. We're mostly degenerates, but on the weekends we're hard working, motivated engineers. Although I often find myself frustrated with other team members, I love this group of hoonigans. 

It was one of my hardest and most rewareding challenges I've ever had in my undergraduate career.
