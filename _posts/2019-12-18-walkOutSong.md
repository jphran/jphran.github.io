## Background

What is a walk out song? It's simply a song that you crank up to full volume while you give everyone the middle finger. 

## The Best Walk Out Song

First, honorable mentions. Solid baseline, deep angry vocals, and a whole lotta respect is needed for a good walk out song. DMX knows his stuff, he's been around long enough. It also helps that everyone knows the song. If anyone is trying to argue this, I would direct them here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGx6K90TmCI"><b>X Gon' Give It To Ya</b></a>

Beastie boys have a classic feel and they really nailed the idgaf energy in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rRZdiu1UE"><b>Sabotage</b></a>. Hard guitar, screamy vocals, everything one looks for in the best walkout song ever.
